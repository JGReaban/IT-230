# IT-230
Programs created for the SNHU Class IT-230, C#
Included are two programs (and design documents) for essentially the same version of a program, one using console and one using a windows
form.

They are essentially the same, only the one using the console was largely written from scratch, while the windows form was mostly provided
and modified.
